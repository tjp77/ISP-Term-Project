Puzzle game site done for the Internet Systems Programming class, allowing custom puzzle image upload. I was responsible for creation of the database and all interactions with it along with other misc. site features, as listed in the Technically documentation page. Includes account security features such as use of PHP prepared statement, only storing hashed versions of user passwords in the database, and using session keys for login cookies, which expire after a certain amount of time, and are reset when a user signs out or logs in again. Built with PHP and MySQL database.
